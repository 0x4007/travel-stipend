# Country Code Mapping Improvements

## Summary
We've improved the country code mapping system to better handle non-standard country representations in the travel stipend calculator. These changes enhance our ability to correctly identify countries from various formats and normalize them to standard ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes.

## Key Improvements

1. **Enhanced Country Name Variations**:
   - Added extensive mapping for country name variations
   - Grouped by region (Europe, Asia, Middle East, North America)
   - Included native language names (e.g., "España" → "ES")
   - Added common name variations (e.g., "UK" → "GB")
   - Added US state handling (e.g., "Texas" → "US")

2. **Improved Normalization Logic**:
   - Updated the `normalizeCityCountry` function to handle 2-letter codes more intelligently
   - Added special handling for codes like "UK" that aren't valid ISO codes but are commonly used
   - Prioritized direct mappings from the variations table
   - Verified ISO code validity before using directly

3. **More Resilient Distance Calculation**:
   - Modified `getDistanceKmFromCities` to handle errors gracefully
   - Returns NaN instead of throwing errors when coordinates aren't found
   - Added better logging for coordinate lookup failures

## Test Results

### Country Code Lookup
All 20 test cases for country code lookup passed successfully, including:
- Common names (e.g., "United States" → "US")
- Abbreviations (e.g., "USA" → "US")
- Alternative names (e.g., "Britain" → "GB")
- Non-English names (e.g., "España" → "ES")

### City-Country Normalization
All 10 test cases for city-country normalization passed successfully:
- "London, UK" correctly normalizes to city: "London", country: "GB"
- "Tokyo, JP" correctly normalizes to city: "Tokyo", country: "JP"
- "Berlin, DE" correctly normalizes to city: "Berlin", country: "DE"
- Special cases like "Singapore" and "Hong Kong" with no country code also work correctly

### Distance Calculation
Testing distance calculation against the default city list showed:
- 7 out of 10 test cities had valid coordinates and distances calculated
- 3 cities (Brooklyn, Montreal, Florence) have no coordinates in the database
- Seoul to Helsinki: 7,032km
- Seoul to Vilnius: 7,336km
- Seoul to Abu Dhabi: 6,837km

## Next Steps

1. **Database Improvements**:
   - Add coordinates for missing cities (Brooklyn, Montreal, Florence, etc.)
   - Consider using external geocoding services for cities not in our database

2. **Coordinate Matching**:
   - Add fuzzy matching for city names to improve coordinate lookup success rate
   - Implement region/state handling for cities with common names

3. **Flight Price Testing**:
   - Run full flight price prediction tests against Google Flights with the improved mapping
   - Analyze error rates before and after these improvements
