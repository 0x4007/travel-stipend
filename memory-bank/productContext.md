# Product Context: Travel Stipend Calculator

## Problem Statement

Seed-stage startups face several challenges when managing travel expenses for employees attending conferences:

1. **Inconsistent reimbursement policies** lead to perceived unfairness when employees travel to locations with vastly different costs of living.

2. **Manual calculation of appropriate stipends** is time-consuming and prone to errors, especially when accounting for multiple factors like flight distance, local costs, and conference duration.

3. **Budget predictability issues** arise when travel costs vary significantly between different conference locations and times of year.

4. **Lack of standardization** in how travel expenses are calculated makes it difficult to plan and allocate resources efficiently.

5. **Administrative overhead** increases as finance teams must review and approve each travel expense individually without clear guidelines.

1. **Automating fair stipend calculations** based on objective factors like distance, cost of living, and conference duration.

2. **Standardizing the reimbursement process** with a consistent methodology that accounts for regional cost differences.
