## Known Issues

### High Priority

üêõ **City Name Matching Failures**
- Some cities with unusual formats fail to match
- Need more robust normalization
- Consider adding city aliases

üêõ **Flight Price Volatility**
- API prices can vary significantly
- Need strategies for price stabilization
- Consider averaging multiple lookups

### Medium Priority

üêõ **Weekend Rate Calculation**
- Edge cases around conference spanning weekends
- Need more testing for date boundary conditions

üêõ **Missing Cost of Living Data**
- Some cities lack cost of living information
- Need fallback strategy for missing data

### Low Priority

üêõ **CSV Format Sensitivity**
- Strict requirements for input CSV format
- Need more robust parsing with error recovery

üêõ **Memory Usage**
- Large datasets can consume significant memory
- Consider streaming for very large datasets

## Next Milestone Goals

1. **Complete Flight API Integration**
   - Reliable flight price lookups
   - Proper error handling and fallbacks
   - Caching to reduce API calls

2. **Expand Data Coverage**
   - Add at least 50 more cities to coordinates database
   - Update cost of living data for all major conference cities
   - Add more comprehensive taxi fare data

3. **Implement Multiple Origin Support**
   - Command-line parameter for origin city
   - Configuration file for default origins
   - Support for per-employee home locations

4. **Enhance Testing**
   - Achieve 80%+ test coverage
   - Add integration tests for main workflows
   - Implement automated testing in CI
