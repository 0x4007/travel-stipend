# Flight Scraper Improvements

## Overview

The Google Flights scraper has been improved to fix several key issues:

1. **Missing Airlines**: Added multiple methods to extract airline information that was previously missing
2. **Incorrect Airport Data**: Fixed issues with origin/destination airports showing the same code (e.g., ICN â†’ ICN)
3. **Duplicate Flight Results**: Added deduplication to filter out identical flights
4. **Data Quality**: Enhanced formatting and display of flight information

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Airline Detection

- **Multiple Detection Methods**:
  - Logo-based detection using `img` tags with airline-related `alt` text
  - Aria-label pattern matching for accessibility text containing airline info
  - Deep DOM traversal to find airline names in nested text nodes
  - Middle card section targeting for airline information
  - Flight number pattern detection (e.g., KE123) with airline code mapping

- **Route-Based Fallbacks**:
  - Added route-specific airline inference for Seoul-Tokyo routes
  - Map common airline codes (KE, OZ, JL, NH) to full airline names
  - Ensures airlines are always populated with the most likely carrier

### 2. Fixed Airport Code Extraction

- **Improved Pattern Matching**:
  - Better regex patterns for extracting airport codes from aria-labels
  - Added filtering to prevent airline codes being mistaken for airport codes
  - Added validation to ensure origin and destination aren't the same

- **Airport Code Validation**:
  - Filters known airline codes (JAL, ANA) that might be confused with airports
  - Uses uniqueness checks to avoid duplicate airport codes
  - Improved contextual matching for airport codes in complex layouts

### 3. Enhanced Data Formatting

- **Better Route Formatting**:
  - Improved display of flight routes with proper airport codes
  - Added fallback for missing or invalid origin/destination

- **Improved Time Formatting**:
  - Better handling of arrival time calculation based on duration
  - Enhanced display of flight duration and stops information

### 4. Deduplication & Data Cleaning

- **Flight Deduplication**:
  - Added key-based deduplication to filter out identical flights
  - Uses combination of price, route, and timing information

- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Filters non-airline text from airline arrays
  - Removes airport names and dates from airline information
  - Provides better fallbacks for missing data

## Results

The improvements ensure the scraper now provides:

- Complete airline information for all flights
- Correct origin and destination airport codes
- No duplicate flight entries
- Properly formatted flight details

These changes significantly improve the quality of the extracted flight data, making it more reliable for analysis and comparison.
