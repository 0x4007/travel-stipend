## Known Issues

### High Priority

üêõ **City Name Matching Failures**

- Some cities with unusual formats fail to match
- Need more robust normalization
- Consider adding city aliases

üêõ **Flight Price Volatility**

- Scraped prices can vary significantly
- Need strategies for price stabilization
- Consider averaging multiple lookups

### Medium Priority

üêõ **Weekend Rate Calculation**

- Edge cases around conference spanning weekends
- Need more testing for date boundary conditions

üêõ **Missing Cost of Living Data**

- Some cities lack cost of living information
- Need fallback strategy for missing data

üêõ **Scraper Reliability**

- Google Flights UI can change, breaking selectors
- Some destinations fail to scrape consistently
- Need for more robust error handling and recovery (Partially addressed: `try...catch` added in calculator)

### Low Priority

üêõ **CSV Format Sensitivity**

- Strict requirements for input CSV format
- Need more robust parsing with error recovery

üêõ **Memory Usage**

- Large datasets can consume significant memory
- Consider streaming for very large datasets
